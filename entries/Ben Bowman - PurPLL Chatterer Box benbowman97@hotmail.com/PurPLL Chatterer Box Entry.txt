The PurPLL Chatterer Box : Ben Bowman

The only three sounds in this song that weren't derived from the sound pack 
are the kick drum, the snare, and there is a Bass/808 type sound that is 
bass guitar through the Future Impact pedal into my Broughton PLL pedal
 (to keep the mood the same). Everything else was made in Ableton with 
the samples.
