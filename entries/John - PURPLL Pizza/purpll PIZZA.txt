Cooking:

- samples burned to CD and then forced to skip 
- used only Montreal Assembly’s Count to 5 (left channel) and 856 for ZELLERSASN (right channel) 
to cook the sounds in St Celfer’s Step.4D oven

Eat:

Yummy!  Feel free to use this pizza any way you wish since they are all Montreal Assembly,
 “The Maximum Melody Maker”, Samples by St Celfer.
