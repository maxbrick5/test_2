Hi!

This is my entry for the PLL contest.
It's a drone improvisation, recorded live in one go with just a few pedals:
There's (of course) some CT5 in here, playing some notes in Mode 3 grabbed from a little cranked 
music box (you'd never guess but it's actually playing the Harry Potter main theme :D ).
Then the PurPLL kicks in with the lead/drone, which was a very happy accident with the 
LFO settings for both MPY and DIV in drone mode.
Some vocals enter via a loopstation, and some delay/verb (Polymoon) and some wobble 
(Julianna) to smear it all out.
Oh, and to kick things up a notch the PurPLL goes through my circuit-bent DS-1 halfway
 through (it self-oscillates and plays lovely against the PurPLL's tracking settings).

And that's it!
The jam is a BIT long perhaps and recording levels weren't great..
..but I'm sending this anyway cause IMO it perfectly shows how playful and inspirational 
(and... controllable! Unlike many others) this take on a PLL pedal really is.

Kind regards,
