Artist name - Dinky Mirage

Track Title - Victim and PURPLLtrator 

Track info - Victim and PURPLLtrator was created using only sounds and samples contained within the 
provided sample pack. Sounds were shaped, warped and sequenced with the help of an AKAI sampler. 

Thoughts - I was quite surprised by the range of sounds included in the sample pack.
 I previously had thought of PURPLL as a one trick pony pedal, but now I see it is also 
a very capable synth on it's own.
If I don't end winning I might just have to grab a PURPLL down the line anyway as 
I already want to hear more of what it is capable of. 

Thank you so much for your time and consideration,
Morgan (Dinky)
