Title: GRAPE CRUSH

Hey guys! I loved so many of the distorted, feedback-y synth samples in the PURPLL
 pack and thought to try to use them to make something high energy and old school 
french electro house-inspired (as a longtime and avid fan of Ed Banger :D). 
The first samples that popped out to me were the "filtered-pwm-waves" and "jack-white" samples.
 I gave a bit more meat to the bass by layering in a square wave sub with these samples before
 some pretty heavy-handed use of distortion and compression to get the sound I wanted. 
Those "glitch" samples were great to chop, tune, and use as transitional parts because they 
had so many grainy textures. The screamy, sync lead sound of "chaos-1" was useful to use as 
a upper register lead element in the latter parts after using some rhythmic filter modulation.
 Anyway, I had a lot of fun using these samples to make this little demo. Hope you enjoy listening 
and thanks for the opportunity!

p.s. I lived in Montreal for 6 years and had the most amazing, life-changing time in that beautiful city.
 It was there where I discovered a love for music and the arts which I continue to hold dearly to this day. 
I now live in Toronto, but I sincerely hope that you and everyone there are keeping well during this 
difficult time! Best wishes.


[Specific Sample Use]

Main bassline was made entirely of the following samples pitched and processed with various distortion plugins (exception to addition of square wave sub):
- filtered-pwm-waves (e.g. 0:15)
- bad-cable (e.g. 0:22)
- jack-white (e.g. 0:14)
- pulses (e.g. 0:30)
- arp-2 (e.g. 1:10, minor octave up part)

Transitional glitchy chops of samples with similar processing interspersed with the bass to add interesting parts:
- glitch-4  (e.g. 0:14) 
- rumble-1 (e.g. 0:33)

Lead elements:
- pulses-2 (e.g. 0:30, quieter middle lead)
- chaos-1 (e.g. 0:30, filtered modulated upper sync lead)

FX elements:
- phony (e.g. 0:30, sparkly texture)
- non-binary (e.g. 0:46)
- phantom-cartridge (e.g. 1:16)
- carwash-happytime (e.g. 1:48)

Percussive elements:
- rythm-2 (e.g. 0:46, low kick during build)
