Matthew LaBarbera

The sounds of the sample pack, as well as PLLs in general, reminded me very much of the sounds 
of early electronic experiments. My piece attempts to capture some of that exploratory spirit.
 My sound sources were all from the sample pack and sent through an effects chain consisting of 
a Count to Five, Moomindrone, and Context V1. They were arranged a treated with equalization & 
dynamic processing in Live. My title "Nexium" is reference to the science or science-fiction names 
given to many early electronic pieces as well as the source of the sounds ("The Purple Pill").
