PurPLL contest submission

Name: Joe Strutt

For archival/public purposes, I'd prefer if this was included on the list
 of entries under my project name, Heraclitus Akimbo (https://heraclitusakimbo.bandcamp.com/) 

Title of piece: PurPLL contest entry 
(descriptive!)

No samples were used in the creation of this piece — I plugged in my PurPLL instead.
Sound-sources were lap steel, Rucci Touch Synthesizer, and human voice. 

Keep on rockin' in the free world!
