I like the idea of layering samples in funny ways...
Went for something a bit atmospheric this time.

A few samples thrown into Simplers in Ableton, played at different pitches and different lengths,
with effects applied, resampled and re-played at new, different pitches. I've mostly used the 
"xcv forever" sample. The glitchy sounds ar semi-generative patterns if samples slices.
