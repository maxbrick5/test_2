hi. thank you for this contest, it was fun playing thru the samples. i used Arp1, arp2 arp3 
and arp4 played from my phone (just one after the other from the cloud), into my splitter, 
then into my pedal board, into my zoomr16 recorder. There are three tracks of sound. I then
 pre-mixed it onto my phone and completed the mix in garageband. Pedals used: DD6, BF2, DD5,
 Draume, T2 Reverb, Colour Theory, tararira, Abracadabra. (My attack decay and nyc big muff are
 the chain, but I donâ€™t think were used for the uploaded recording). It would be my extreme 
pleasure to permanently add PURPLL to this list of extreme misfits, and thank you for the 
opportunity to win one.
