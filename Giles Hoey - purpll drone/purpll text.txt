Hello friends.

All of this piece is made using only the sample pack, chopped and run through 
some loopers and some effects and  definitely some feedback. I had planned 
to record to my zoom, as per usual, but it broke so I had to commit it to tape on a 
4 track my mate gave me from her late grandfather’s garage (first time I ever used it!).
I loved doing this! So nice to have a brief - the potential pot of gold is a bonus. 
What ever the outcome I sure look forward to getting some mtl.asm pedals in the future.
